                    Within my thrifted copy of "The Celestine Prophecy," there are private scrawlings of the previous owner(s). 
                    These are responses to intimate writing prompts, so I felt as though it was inappropriate for these words to be reused or abused. 
                    From this discovery and discussions regarding “Document” and ownership of creative works, I created this project.

                    The <a class="hover:text-green-400 active:text-black underline" href="./original.html">Original</a> poem stems from in-class discussions.
                    It considers creators (of any kind), their inspirations and predecessors, source material, and the complications sprung from the Western notion of ownership. 
                    I provide no answers to these issues. Just another question.
                    How should creators consider our shared struggles of sourcing and attribution, ownership and claim, and respect and responsibility?

                    The <a class="hover:text-green-400 active:text-black underline" href="./index.html">Remix</a> poem is fleeting, unique, and questionable in ownership.
                    The words that are replaced are those from the table of contents of "The Celestine Prophecy."
                    Each word is replaced with a unique, random word from a list of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.
